#### About

After attending Villanova College as part of the class of 1919, Joseph McHugh joined the US Army during WWI. He served as a Private in the 79th Infantry Division, which was primarily comprised of Maryland and Pennsylvania recruits. After a year of training at Camp Meade, McHugh’s division was sent to Europe, where it earned the nickname “Cross of Lorraine” for the troops’ defense of France. McHugh fought in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive near Verdun, France. This was the deadliest battle in American history, resulting in 350,000 casualties overall. McHugh lost his life on November 11, 1918, the day of the armistice that ended WWI. He was laid to rest at the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery in France.
