#### About

Joseph Alfred McGinley, of Norristown, PA, attended Villanova College for two years before transferring to the US Naval Academy, from which he graduated in 1921. He joined the US Navy and earned the rank of Lieutenant and was stationed in the submarine USS S-4 (SS-109). In 1927, the submarine was accidentally rammed by the ship USCGC Paulding (CG-17) off the coast of Provincetown, Massachusetts. The collision punctured the submarine and resulted in the deaths of the thirty-nine crewmen, including McGinley, and the one civilian observer who were present inside, despite rescue efforts that were quickly made. McGinely is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 6, Grave 8373.
