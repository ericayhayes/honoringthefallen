#### About

After attending Villanova College, Walter Henry Lang, Jr. joined the United States Marine Corps, where he earned the rank of Staff Sergeant in the 1st Marine Aviation Wing. In 1942, Lang’s unit fought in the Battle of Midway, a major turning point in WWII, and returned to the US to prepare for additional flights to the Islands surrounding Japan. During a training accident, Lang’s aircraft collided with another, and the pilot lost his life. Lang is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, in Yeadon, PA.
