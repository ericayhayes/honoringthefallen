#### About

James William Haggerty, from Webster, Worcester County, Massachusetts, studied economics at Villanova College until 1942, when he left college to join the service during World War II. In the US Navy, Haggerty earned the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade and was stationed in Japan aboard the USS Pinkney (APH-2), an evacuation transport ship. He was killed in action in 1945 when a Japanese kamikaze hit the USS Pinkney, which at the time was sailing in Hagushi Bay off the coast of Okinawa. Haggerty was one of 18 crew members and 16 patients who lost their lives during the attack. As a result, he was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart. After being temporarily interred overseas, Haggerty was repatriated on June 27, 1950, and buried at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery, SECTION 84, SITE 174-176.
