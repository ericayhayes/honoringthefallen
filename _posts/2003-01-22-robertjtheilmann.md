#### About

Robert J. Theilmann, of East Northport, Long Island, graduated from Villanova University’s NROTC program in 1977. After graduation, he went on to earn the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Marine Corps. He served in Iraq during the Gulf War and at several military posts in California. At the time of his death, Theilmann was a member of the Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron based at Camp Pendleton, California. He and three other Marine Reserve aviators died on January 22, 2003, when two AH-1W Super Cobra helicopters accidentally crashed during a night anti-drug patrol at Falcon State Park near Zapata, Texas. According to his wife Barbara, Robert Theilmann had said that “If you’re going to marry a Marine pilot, you have to know that I’ll be the first one in whenever there’s trouble.” His brother Richard said that Robert Theilmann “was a self-sacrificing kind of guy” and “an exemplary career officer.” Theilmann was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 60, Site 7898.
