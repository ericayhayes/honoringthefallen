#### About

James A. Kelly, Jr., of Phoenixville, PA, attended the Malvern Preparatory School and was later a part of the Class of 1963 at Villanova College, where he majored in Economics. During his time on campus, Kelly took part in the sailing club and the Society for the Advancement of Management. During the Vietnam War, Kelly joined the US Navy, earned the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade, and was staioned aboard the USS Oriskany. On October 26, 1966, the vessel was in the Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of Vietnam, 44 sailors died and 156 were injured from an accidental rocket warhead explosion in the ship, which in turn caused a second warhead to detonate and spread fire and smoke throughout much of the ship. The initial explosion was the result of two sailors accidentally dropping MK-24 Mod 3 Flares as they were restocking them; the heat from an ignited flare caused the first warhead to detonate. Kelly was one of the sailors who died in this incident. He was buried at Saint Ann Cemetery in Phoenixville, PA.
