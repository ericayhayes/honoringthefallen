John Corkill, son of Isabelle and James Corkill of Mauch Chunk, PA, graduated from Villanova in 1934 with a Bachelor of Arts. During his time on campus, John served as the editor-in-chief of the Belle Air yearbook, where he gave “many long hours of work and worry,” much as he was “outstanding in the diligence with which he pursued his scholastic studies.” John served as a Staff Sergeant in the US Army during World War II. In 1945, he died in action in Belgium and was laid to rest at the Henri-Chapelle American Cemetery in Hombourg.
