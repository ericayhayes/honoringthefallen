Matthew Claar was born on October 14, 1964. He lived in Newtown, PA before enrolling in Villanova’s NROTC program and graduating in 1986. Matthew joined the US Navy and earned the rank of Lieutenant. According to his roommate aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, Matthew’s call sign was “Planet,” after a song entitled “Planet Claire” by the band, “The B-52s.” During routine carrier operations in the Indian Ocean on July 20, 1993, an accident occurred when Matthew’s F-14 fighter plane crashed into the USS Abraham Lincoln. He is buried at the Washington Crossing United Methodist Cemetery in Bucks County, PA.
