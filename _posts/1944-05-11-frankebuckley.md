#### About

Frank Edward Buckley, of Lakewood, NJ, graduated from Villanova College with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics in 1942. While at Villanova, Buckley was also involved in the music seminar, the Belle Masque, and the Holy Name Society. He was drafted soon after and joined the US Army as a 2nd Lieutenant. Buckley died in Cassino, Italy during Operation Diadem, an Allied offensive operation against the German 10th Army. As a result of his service during this battle, Buckley was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, as his “intrepid actions, personal bravery and zealous devotion to duty at the cost of his life, exemplify the highest traditions of the military forces of the United States and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.” Buckley is buried in the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, VA.
