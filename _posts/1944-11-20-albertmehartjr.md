#### About

Albert M. Ehart, Jr. was the son of Albert M. Ehart, who published the newspaper Suburban and Wayne Times. He lived at 204 Midland Ave. in Wayne, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Valley Forge Military Academy in 1941. Ehart joined the Army as a Second Lieutenant on April 25, 1942, and completed a motor maintenance course at Fort Benning, Georgia before being promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant. At the same time, he was taking a pre-medical course at Villanova College as part of the class of 1945. On November 20, 1944, Ehart died at the Battle of HÃ¼rtgen Forest, near the German-Belgian border. The battle took place from September 19 to December 16, 1944, making it the longest WWII battle on German ground, as well as the longest single battle that the US Army has ever fought. Ehart was buried at St. Denis Cemetery, in Havertown, Pennsylvania.
