#### About

Jeffrey Charles Lemon, of Flossmoor, Illinois, graduated from Mendel Catholic High School. He earned a degree in civil engineering from Villanova University in 1965. While at Villanova, Lemon participated in extracurricular activities such as baseball, intramural sports, the intramural athletics council, and the rifle team. At this time, he also met his future wife, Jane. During the Vietnam War, Lemon joined the US Air Force as a member of the 421st Tactical Fighter Squadron. On April 25, 1971, he piloted a McDonnell Douglas Phantom II Fighter (F-4D) (tail number: 66-007616) from Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam to an area fifteen miles northeast of Ban Phone in Salavan (or Saravane) Province, Laos. The purpose of the mission was to escort AC-119 gunship on a night reconnaissance and strike mission. After about two hours, the gunship used a flare to point Lemon’s aircraft to a target, but Lemon said that he could not see the flare and proceeded north to acquire it. Lemon’s Phantom was not seen again after this point; it is presumed to have been lost northeast of Ban Phone, in Sekong (or Xekong) Province, Laos. The bodies of Lemon and his one crewmate on the Phantom were never recovered. While declared MIA, Lemon was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. He was later memorialized on the Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii, as well as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall (Panel 03 West, Line 12) in Washington, DC.
