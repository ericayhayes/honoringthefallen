John D. Schuyler, of Schenectady, NY, earned a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Villanova College in 1939. During his time at Villanova, he participated in golf and intramurals. The Belle-Air yearbook describes John as “an ardent swimmer, golfer, and pinochle player,” “a student of philosophy,” and “a sincere friend.” During World War II, John served as a Sergeant in the US Army as part of the Third Army, attached to the 68th Tank Battalion, 6th Armored Division. He was injured and when his tank was shot and was awarded a Purple Heart. After returning to active duty, John was declared missing in action in 1945 while fighting in Belgium’s Ardennes Forest; he was later confirmed to have been killed in action. John’s life and service are commemorated among the Tablets of the Missing at the Ardennes American Cemetery in Neupré, Belgium.
