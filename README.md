## [Honoring the Fallen: An Interactive Memorial Map](https://falveydigitalscholarship.github.io/honoringthefallen/)

This is the repository for the mapping project: Honoring the Fallen: An Interactive Memorial Map. This map is part of [The Voices of Villanova Veterans](https://veteransvoices.library.villanova.edu/) oral history project, in collaboration with the [Office of Veterans and Military Service Members](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/enroll/veterans-military.html) and Falvey Memorial Library's [Digital Scholarship Program](https://library.villanova.edu/collections/distinctive/digitallibrary/digital-scholarship) and the [Department of Distinctive Collections and Digital Engagement Department](https://library.villanova.edu/collections/distinctive). This map displays the names of veterans with a connection to Villanova University, along with their branch of service, year and location of death.

This mapping project was built with [Flâneur](https://github.com/kirschbombe/flaneur), a Jekyll theme for maps and texts using Leaflet developed by Niquii O'Niell and Dawn Childress, and is based on the earlier [Boulevardier](https://github.com/kirschbombe/boulevardier) framework. The map was designed and developed by Erica Hayes and the content for the map was curated by Michael Brown, Laura Bang, Dave Uspal, and Michael Foight at Villanova University.

This map is still a work in progress...more coming soon...
