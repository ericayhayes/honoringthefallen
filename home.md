title: "Honoring the Fallen: An Interactive Memorial Map"
---

[The Office of Veterans and Military Service Members](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/enroll/veterans-military.html) at [Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/university.html) is collecting data and information on all [veterans](https://memorialmap.library.villanova.edu/#/article-index/) killed in service, with a connection to Villanova. This map displays the names of these veterans, along with their branch of service, location, and year of death. For those veterans reported missing in action, we have mapped the nearest location of where they were last seen.

This project will honor the life and sacrifice of Villanova veterans who died while serving their country. Through extensive research, and collaboration, our team, through this interactive memorial map, will memorialize and remember their service.

In doing so, we hope to educate present and future generations about the cost of freedom, and the legacy of service that Villanova is so proud of. This map allows users, anywhere on the globe to access this map, and creates an access point for family members, the community, historians, and anyone else interested in learning about their legacy.

When you browse this map, you will see pins scattered across the globe, and when you click on a pin, it will bring up the person’s name, some pictures, some details surrounding the service member, and the circumstance surrounding their death. As more information becomes known, we will update the map.

We hope that through this project we can increase awareness across campus and in our community. Military service ought to be recognized and respected, and through this mapping project we are paying tribute to their service and sacrifice by ensuring that they are never forgotten.

In collaboration with Falvey Library’s [Distinctive Collections and Digital Engagement Department](https://library.villanova.edu/collections/distinctive) and [Digital Scholarship Program](https://blog.library.villanova.edu/2020/03/09/coming-to-falvey-digital-scholarship-lab/), this map was made possible. This project is part of the [Voices of Villanova Veterans oral history project](https://veteransvoices.library.villanova.edu) documenting the stories of Veterans at Villanova University.

If you have information about a Villanova student or alum who was killed in service to their country, please visit the [participate page](https://veteransvoices.library.villanova.edu/participate/) on the [Voices of Villanova Veterans](https://veteransvoices.library.villanova.edu/) website to fill out the form in order to contribute a name to  the memorial map.
