<p>Michael DeBartolomeo was a naval aviator stationed at Whitney Island Naval air Station. He was on a tour with the USS America in July, 1984 when he lost his life. Michael was the pilot of an EA-6B prowler an electronics warfare aircraft. On the night of July 10th 1984, Michael‚Äôs plane was launched off the USS America and there was a catastrophic failure of the catapult system resulting in what is referred to as a cold cat. Michael immediately initiated the ejection order which saved his 3 crew members. Michael was fatally injured during the ejection. Michael left behind a young wife, his parents and four younger siblings. For the past 35 years, a sword is presented by a family member to a deserving senior in Michael‚Äôs memory during the Villanova NROTC Spring Review.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI was on the inboard side of cat-4 when this happened. I witnessed the event and I can tell you that 3 air crewman owe their lives to ‚ÄúLt.j.g. Michael J. DeBartolomeo. He initiated command ejection when his aircraft failed to reach flight speed on cat-3. When the forward ECMOS seat drogue parachute opened the upward/ outboard draft proppelled that seat over the command seat, as it exited the aircraft Lt.j.g. Michael J. DeBartolomeo struck the bottom of the ejection gun and I believe that caused his death. Had he punched himself out he would probably have survived and his crew mates may not have. God bless Lt.j.g. Michael J. DeBartolomeo. In my eyes he is a hero.‚Äù</p>
