<p>Michael Martin “Nick” Basca enlisted in the United States Army after the attack on Pearl Harbor and was eventually assigned as a tank commander in the 4th Armored Division. He was killed instantly when his tank was struck by an anti-tank round after four months in combat. He is currently honored in the Football’s Wartime Heroes display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He played one season for the Philadelphia Eagles (1941).</p>

<p>Before his time in the NFL and the US Army, Michael Martin Basca was born on December 4, 1917 to Michael and Mary Basca. His parents emigrated from Austria. Michael Sr. was a steelworker at Phoenixville Steel and football coach at Sacred Heart in 1920-1921. Michael was the second of five children. At an early age, Michael would go house to house in the neighborhood seeking odd jobs for a nickel. He soon became widely known as “Nickels” Basca. The nickname was later shortened to ‘Nick’.</p>

<p>In 1938, Michael began his studies at Villanova University, and continued his stellar athletic performance under coach Clipper Smith. ‘Nick’ did much of the passing, punting and drop kicking, becoming a triple threat. His performance won him a place on the All-State Team, several All-Eastern teams, as well as team captain his senior year. He graduated with a BS in Education in 1941.</p>
