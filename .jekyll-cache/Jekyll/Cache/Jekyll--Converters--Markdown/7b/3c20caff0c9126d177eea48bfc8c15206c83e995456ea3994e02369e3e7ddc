<p>Affectionately nicknamed, Beetle, he was described in the Belle Air Yearbook Class of 1932 as:</p>

<p>“Endowed with such qualities has quickly won him a foremost place in the affection of his comrades. Beetle, was moreover a student of the first rank and an athlete who did much to add to his glory of Villanova. His hearty laughter was ever a source of cheer to us who have known him since matriculation and the hall of Mendel will seem hollow without it’s merry peal. In his four year stay with us, he has acquired a multitude of friends who will cherish many happy memories of him” (page 122).</p>
